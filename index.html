			<p>Bhuna khichuri recipe is an exemplary moong dal khichuri which is immensely popular in Bangladesh, West Bengal and few other parts of north east India. The texture of bhuna khichuri is completely different from other khichuri recipes. It is dry and grainy in texture exactly like pulao with extraordinary taste and flavour. </p>
